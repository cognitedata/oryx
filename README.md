Oryx is a high performance .NET cross platform functional HTTP request handler library for writing HTTP web clients in F#.

> An SDK for writing HTTP web clients or SDKs.

This library enables you to write Web and REST clients and SDKs for various APIs and is currently used by the [.NET SDK for Cognite Data Fusion (CDF)](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-sdk-dotnet).

Oryx is heavily inspired by the [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe) web framework, and applies the same ideas to the client making the web requests. You can think of Oryx as the client equivalent of Giraffe, and you could envision the HTTP request processing pipeline starting at the client and going all the way to the server and back again.

## Fundamentals

The main building blocks in Oryx is the `Context` and the `HttpHandler`. The Context stores all the state needed for making the request and any response or error received from the server:

```fs
type Context<'a> = {
    Request: HttpRequest
    Response: 'a
}
```

The `Context` may be transformed by series of HTTP handlers. The `HttpHandler` takes a `Context` (and a `NextFunc`) and returns a new `Context` wrapped in a `Result` and `Task`.

```fs
type HttpFuncResult<'b> =  Task<Result<Context<'b>, ResponseError>>

type HttpFunc<'a, 'b> = Context<'a> -> HttpFuncResult<'b>
type NextFunc<'a, 'b> = HttpFunc<'a, 'b>

type HttpHandler<'a, 'b, 'c> = NextFunc<'b, 'c> -> Context<'a> -> HttpFuncResult<'c>

// For convenience
type HttpHandler<'a, 'b> = HttpHandler<'a, 'a, 'b>
type HttpHandler<'a> = HttpHandler<HttpResponseMessage, 'a>
type HttpHandler = HttpHandler<HttpResponseMessage>
```

An `HttpHandler` is a plain function that takes two curried arguments, a `NextFunc` and a `Context`, and returns a new `Context` (wrapped in a `Result` and `Task`) when finished. On a high level the `HttpHandler` function takes and returns a context object, which means every `HttpHandler` function has full control of the outgoing `HttpRequest` and also the resulting response.

Each HttpHandler usually adds more info to the `HttpRequest` before passing it further down the pipeline by invoking the next `NextFunc` or short circuit the execution by returning a result of `Result<Context<'a>, ResponseError>`. E.g if an HttpHandler detects an error, then it can return `Result.Error` to fail the processing.

The easiest way to get your head around a Oryx `HttpHandler` is to think of it as a functional Web request processing pipeline. Each handler has the full `Context` at its disposal and can decide whether it wants to fail the request by returning an `Error`, or continue the request by passing on a new `Context` to the "next" handler, `NextFunc`.

The more complex way to think about a `HttpHandler` is that there are in fact 3 different ways it may process the request:

1. Call the next handler with an `Ok` result value, and return what the next handler is returning.
2. Return an `Error`result to fail the request.
3. Return `Ok` to short circuit the processing. This is not something you would normally do.

## Operators

The fact that everything is an `HttpHandler` makes it easy to compose handlers together. You can think of them as lego bricks that you can fit together. Two `HttpHandler` functions may be composed together using Kleisli composition, i.e using the fish operator `>=>`.

```fs
let (>=>) a b = compose a b
```

The `compose` function is the magic that sews it all togheter and explains how you can curry the `HttpHandler` to generate a new `NextFunc` that you give to next `HttpHandler`. If the first handler fails, the next handler will be skipped.

```fs
let compose (first : HttpHandler<'a, 'b, 'd>) (second : HttpHandler<'b, 'c, 'd>) : HttpHandler<'a,'c,'d> =
    fun (next: NextFunc<_, _>) (ctx : Context<'a>) ->
        let func =
            next
            |> second
            |> first

        func ctx
```

This enables you to compose your web requests and decode the response, e.g as we do when listing Assets in the  the [Cognite Data Fusion SDK](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-sdk-dotnet/blob/master/src/assets/ListAssets.fs#L55):

```fs
    let listAssets (options: AssetQuery seq) (filters: AssetFilter seq) (fetch: HttpHandler<HttpResponseMessage, 'a>) =
        let decodeResponse = Decode.decodeContent AssetItemsReadDto.Decoder id
        let request : Request = {
            Filters = filters
            Options = options
        }

        POST
        >=> setVersion V10
        >=> setContent (Content.JsonValue request.Encoder)
        >=> setResource Url
        >=> fetch
        >=> Decode.decodeError
        >=> decodeResponse
```

Thus the function `listAssets` is now also an `HttpHandler` and may be composed with other handlers to create complex chains for doing series of multiple requests to a web service.

There is also a `retry` that retries HTTP handlers using max number of retries and exponential backoff.

```fs
val retry : (initialDelay: int<ms>) -> (maxRetries: int) -> (handler: HttpHandler<'a,'b,'c>) -> (next: NextFunc<'b,'c>) -> (ctx: Context<'a>) -> Task<Context<'c>>
```

And a `concurrent` operator that runs a list of HTTP handlers in parallel.

```fs
val concurrent : (handlers: HttpHandler<'a, 'b, 'b> seq) -> (next: NextFunc<'b list, 'c>) -> (ctx: Context<'a>) -> Task<Context<'c>>
```

## JSON and Protobuf

Oryx will serialize (and deserialize) JSON using `Thoth.Json.Net` or Protobuf using `Google.Protobuf`.

Both encode and decode uses streaming so no large strings or arrays will be allocated in the process.

## Computational Expression Builder

Working with `Context` objects can be a bit painful since the actual result will be available inside a `Task` effect that has a `Result` that can be either `Ok` with the response or `Error`. To make it simpler to handle multiple requests using handlers you can use the `oryx` builder that will hide the complexity of both the `Context` and the `Result`.

```fs
    oryx {
        let! a = fetchData "service1"
        let! b = fetchData "service2"

        return a + b
    }
```

To run a handler u can use the `runHandler` function.

```fs

val runHandler : (handler: HttpHandler<'a,'b,'b>) -> (ctx : Context<'a>) -> Task<Result<'b, ResponseError>>

```

## TODO

- The library currently depends on [`Thoth.Json.Net`](https://mangelmaxime.github.io/Thoth/). This should at some point be split into a separate library.

- The library also assumes the type of the error response. This should perhaps be made more generic.
